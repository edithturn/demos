# Another example of such an operation would be to run transactions which span multiple tables. Letâ€™s say you want to delete a campaign and all its associated ads, you could do it atomically by running:

""" Delete
BEGIN;
DELETE FROM campaigns WHERE id = 46 AND company_id = 5;

COMMIT;

# Select
SELECT name, cost_model, state, monthly_budget
FROM campaigns
WHERE company_id = 5
ORDER BY monthly_budget DESC
LIMIT 10;
